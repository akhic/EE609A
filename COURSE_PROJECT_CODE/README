Simulation codes and files for our project :
"Multi-Period portfolio Optimization using asymmetric GARCH Model ",

We have taken the skeleton of our code from the Source Code on 
https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd%20/papers/port_opt_bound.html. The credit for that part of the code totally goes to
the authors of 
Boyd, Stephen. (2014). Performance Bounds and Suboptimal Policies for Multi-Period Investment. 1. 1-72. 10.1561/2400000001.

Files:
----------------
Return Series Generation : This folder contains the price series data of the stocks that we used and the code
to arrange the data in a single csv file(log_return_full.csv).

data_gen.m : It generates the parameters. It has been taken from the souce code. But we have changed the parameters
and have also changed the mean and covariances of the log return distribution to our empirical calculations.

Simulations_result.m : It plots the required graphs after the simulations have taken place.

run_all.m : It runs all the simulations for the 3 periods and plots the results.

cvx : It contains cvx v1.22

leverage_limit : Contains files for the Leverage Limit Constraints.

long_only : Contains files for the long only Constraints.

unconstrained : Contains files for the unconstrained case. 

Subdirectories: 

Return Series Generation/Combining data.ipynb : This is a jupyter notebook file that clubs
historical data present in the Historical directory and generates 4 csv files, log_returns_100_1.csv,log_returns_100_2.csv,log_returns_100_3.csv,log_return_full.csv
and also estimates the mean and covariance of log return distribution.

The folders leverage_limit, long_only and unconstrained contains:
1. ADP : It has been taken from the source code. We changed in run_adp.m such that it takes to
 run on real data unlikewise before it run on generated data and optimizes and simulated many times. 

2. ADPGARCH : we change in solve_sdp such that it optimizes on variable predictive volatility 
and return mean by fitting and forecasting using GJR(3,3) model. We change in run_adp such it
 optimizes on variable predictive volatility and return mean by fitting and forecasting using
 GJR(3,3) model and run on real data rather than it did earlier by simulating on generated
 data for many simulation

3. MPC : It has been taken from the source code. We change in run_mpc such that it takes to run on real data unlikewise before 
it run on generated data and optimizes and simulated many times. 

4. MPCGARCH :we change in run_mpc such that it optimizes on variable predictive volatility 
and return mean by fitting and forecasting using GJR(3,3) model and run on real data rather
 than it did earlier by simulating on generated data for many simulation

Each of the above files contain cvxgen and make solver files which are used for initialising
the optimization problem. They have also been taken from the source code.
 
5. run.m : It runs the particular example. 

 
---------------------------------
To run the simulations:
---------------------------------
The simulations take about 4 hours to run. 
It has been run already and the plots and simulation results are also present. 
If you don't want to run the simulations, you can just look at the results and the plots.

If you just want to generate the plots, you can run Simulations_result.m. 

After meeting the requirements, run the run_all.m file to run for 
all the constraints over all the periods.

To run simulations for a particular constraint : go to the corresponding folder and run the 
run.m file. 

---------------------------
Results Storage: 
---------------------------
The results for the MPC and MPCGARCH simulations are stored in MPC_data.mat files present in 
the corresponding folders.

The results for the ADP and ADPGARCH simulations are stored in MC_data.mat files present in
the corresponding folders.

The plots are also stores in figx.png files where x = 1-18
